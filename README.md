# Satellite-Trajectory-Tracker

- The system’s design aims to create an interactive platform for real-time satellite tracking and trajectory visualization.  The system is constructed using Python

- The system integrates live Two-Line Element (TLE) data fetched from CelesTrak and parsed with Skyfield and SciPy (a Python astronomy library) to provide accurate and up-to-date satellite orbital information

- The system uses a Python library matplotlib, that allows users to create navigable 3D displays and animations

- The system transforms TLE data into precise metrics such as latitude, longitude, altitude, and velocity using advanced vector calculations and principles of orbital mechanics

- Additionally, the system allows users to interact with a 3D model of the Earth by rotating and zooming in and out, observing the orbital path of different satellites using mouse gestures and controls
